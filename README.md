<p align="justify">Crime Data Analysis for Safer Communities is a comprehensive study of crime trends, highlighting long-term trends and changes. One of the primary goals of this analysis is to lookat seasonal changes in crime and the flow of crime in the past two decades. The Seasonal
trend include collecting crime data at various times to determine if any crime occur frequently
throughout certain seasons. Moreover, the project performs complex computations based on
previous crime data. Complex queries are used to establish the mean of various types of crimes
over a longer period of time rather than within certain seasons.</p>

<p align="justify">Furthermore, this study helps people in analyzing crimes that occur in a certain place across a
specific radius over a long period of time which help users to determine if some locations are
safer than others. Users can also examine how serious crimes have evolved through time with
help of IUCR codes. This allows us to determine if there is any increase in crime rate of certain
serious crimes. This also helps in analyzing crimes occured during the day and night over a
long period of time. This allows user to know when particular types of crimes are more likely
to occur, allowing us to be more prepared for them.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, the project analyzes when crimes occurred on various days of the week and how crime
rate has changed for each day over time. This allows us to identify pattern on which days
specific sorts of crimes are more likely to occur. This project provides a detailed picture of over
time trends of different crimes that residents of city and law enforcement officials may utilize
for informed decision-making and proactive crime prevention efforts.</p>
